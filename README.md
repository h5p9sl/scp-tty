# SCP-TTY

My first PHP project: A simple user-editable fictional wiki heavily inspired by [SCP Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia).

***The site is currently considered incomplete.***
## Site Appearance
The site is supposed to look like you're at an SCP Foundation terminal ("SCP-TTY") wherein you can request and edit "research documents".

## Document Pages
The writer has full creative influence. The document is written in [markdown](https://parsedown.org/).
Javascript written by a user is disabled. By default, anyone can edit documents, just like www.wikipedia.org.
